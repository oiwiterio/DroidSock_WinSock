# DroidSock_WinSock
A client-side Linux socket and a server-side winsock

You can see that there are two large blocks of code in the socket source code of the two platforms. This corresponds to the Spinner S1 = findViewById(R.id.S1); of the java file. This is a radio button. Currently, there is a "picture path" sent. " and "Text" selection, 48484 is the image path port, and 58484 is the text port. Another point, you may need to pay attention to the buffer size of port 48484.

You can refer to some of the ideas of the code, but I can't guarantee exactly what will happen
